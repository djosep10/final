	 <h4>Prince</h4>
	 <p>Prince is one of the best success stories in music. Growing up Minnesota, Prince has hand in interest in music since he was a child. His musical talent was enough to be recognized and signed by Warner Bros Records and in 1984, he released the album Purple Rain. Since that time, Prince has been regarded as one of the most creative and popular forces in music history. In 2015, Prince decided to pull all of his music from streaming platforms except Tidal who is ran by his friend Jay Z. After his untimely passing in 2017, his estate decided to release his music back into the streaming world. I would like to say that Prince’s estate since his passing has not been doing business as Prince would have wanted.

	 <h4>Taylor Swift</h4>
	 <p>In late 2014, Taylor Swift, after releasing her album “1989”, pulled all her music from the streaming platform Spotify. She cited continuous changes in the landscape of music, and companies like Spotify not willing to pay for artists’ work. Taylor Swift, being one of the most famous and recognizable names of our generation spoke out for all artists, even though her herself stood to make millions of dollars by releasing music on streaming platforms collectively. A few months later, she put her music on Tidal, the streaming platform that requires people to pay for an individual’s art. She agreed like many other artists that with higher premiums for the service, it allows artist to make more of the money that they deserve. While holding out for 4 years, Taylor Swift put her music back on Spotify after Daniel Ek, Spotify CEO had multiple meetings with Taylor and her team.

	 <h4>Adele</h4>
	 <p>I feel Adele set the standard for what sales will have to be in the future. In her latest album titled “25”, she released only physical copies to her fans, which still got over 3 million purchases. During the time of the release, she stated that “25” wouldn’t be released on Spotify, therefore forcing her audience to purchase physical copies of her album. Just a year later, she released “25” to streaming platforms. By releasing her music this way, she tapped into the market of her fan base that would pay $20 for her album, maximizing her royalties and even merchandise output as it relates to other artists. After a year of purchases, she released her music to the masses on Spotify, there for ensuring consistent replay value of her released music. The tactic is genius and I feel if more artist do this type of business, being able to make money off music will become easier.
