	Streaming is the ability to listen to song, podcast, or other forms of media through an application. That application does not own the content but is able to stream the content live or keep some form of the data that allows users to listen to songs and podcasts. While in its essence, streaming is the way of the future. Being able to listen to recorded music from the past to new releases every month is an innovation and platform that all artists need to be part of. So why donâ€™t artist like streaming platforms like Spotify and apple music? Refer to this brief video below about streaming.

	The unfair treatment of artist, in the global fueling engine called streaming, its important to note that in the united states, streaming platforms have allowed unfair compensation to songwriters. Its hard to make a living of .00007 per stream. Even though music is not typically looked at as a business, its very complex in expectations for popular artists and their content. By giving songwriters significantly less than what they should or would earn from a physical copy is not just to the songwriters, artists, and record companies.
