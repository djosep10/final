	<p>
	Copyrighting music is the process in which artist go thought to make their art available to sell or distribute to the masses. Where that is a digital release on their website or vinyl records that people purchase. Copyrighting a musical composition comes with some boundaries such as it has to be your original work, you cant copyright a song title or chord progression and submitting information pertaining to the specific song or album of songs you want under copyright. It costs $35 to copyright a song online and $85 for a paper registration. The copyright laws and how they pertain to music streaming services is unique. As it stands, it is up to the artist to set their own individual rates for their licensed music to be on a streaming platform. The exact price is hard to find since all the major deals with artist are under strict secrecy. If an artist does not want their recordings or any other content available on streaming platforms, then it is up to them to opt out of a license agreement with the company. With the inability to obtain other licensing agreements such as a Mechanical license or a public performance license it puts the pressure back on the artist to know what they want out of an agreement. For most small time artists, having any form of income come from their art sounds great, but in a system that allows only streaming platforms to reap all of the benefits while artist are presented with such a yes or no situation is not fair and stunts the growth of the ever evolving form of music. Its important to note that while streaming services do pay money to artists, part of the problem with the amount they are willing to spend can also be attributed to income. Applications like Amazon music unlimited, Napster and Tidal have the three highest price per stream ranging from 0.01196 to 0.00989 per stream. Business such as those have the content but require a monthly payment of $9.99 to access the content. For applications such as YouTube, Apple music, and Spotify, that allows users to use the platform for free has less price per stream. The lowest being YouTube at 0.00163 per stream. The price of streaming platforms, for artist to be paid fair compensation for their art needs to be at least doubled in order to facilitate real financial change to the streaming industry. In my opinion, paying $20 to hear literally ever form of copyrighted music from across the globe seems like a fair price, especially considering what else you pay for monthly.
